    <h2>AALO PARATHA</h2><br>
    <h3 style="text-align: left;">To make aalo ka paratha you need two main components:</h3>
        <ol><li><b>Dough made from whole wheat flour </b>: A basic dough is made with whole wheat flour (atta), salt, oil and water. Making this unleavened dough is very easy and you can either knead it with your hands or in a stand mixer. Do use the Indian atta which is finely ground flour made in a chakki or a stone mill.</li>
        <li><b>Mashed potato stuffing </b>:  Potatoes are boiled, peeled and then mashed. The mashed potatoes are seasoned with herbs, spices and salt, and then are stuffed in a rolled dough before being roasted or fried.</li></ol><br>
    <h3>Make Potato Stuffing</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>First, boil or steam 4 medium-sized potatoes in a pressure cooker, steamer or electric cooker. Add enough water in a 2-litre pressure cooker or pan to just barely cover the potatoes.
    <b>For cooking in a pressure cooker </b>– On a medium heat, cook the potatoes in water for 3 to 4 whistles. When the pressure settles down naturally, remove the lid and drain the water very well. Allow the potatoes to cool enough to handle and then peel them.</li>
    <li>if you haven’t done so yet, peel and chop the warm potatoes. Then mash the potatoes with a potato masher. If you don’t have a potato masher, use a box grater to grate them and then mash the potatoes with a fork</li>
    <li>The potatoes should be mashed very well, with no lumps, chunks or bits. Any lumps in the mix will cause the stuffing to leak out of the dough when rolling.</li>

    <li>Now add the following ingredients, feeling free to vary the spices as you like.</li>

½ to 1 teaspoon finely chopped green chillies (1 to 2 green chilies) or serrano peppers
¼ to ½ teaspoon punjabi garam masala powder or Garam Masala Powder
¼ to ½ teaspoon kashmiri red chilli powder or cayenne pepper or paprika (optional)
½ to 1 teaspoon dry mango powder (amchur powder) – or use lemon juice instead
salt according to your taste</un>
<li>With a spoon, thoroughly mix the ground spices and green chilies into the mashed potatoes to get an even mixture. Set the prepared aloo stuffing aside</li>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Make the Dough</h3>
<li>In a separate bowl, add 2 cups whole wheat flour (atta). Make a well in the center. Add ½ teaspoon salt (or to taste), 1 tablespoon oil or ghee, and roughly ⅓ to ½ cup water.</li>
<li> Bring the mixture together and knead into a smooth, soft dough for 8 to 10 minutes. Add more water if needed. Cover and keep the dough aside, letting it rest for 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
<li>Pinch two small balls from the dough. Flatten them and dust with whole wheat flour.</li>
<li>With a rolling pin, roll them into rounds roughly 4 to 5 inches in diameter. Try making both the discs the same size.</li>
<li>On one of the discs, place the potato stuffing in the center, keeping about 1 inch empty space from the sides.</li>
<li>Gently place the second circle on top</li>
<li>Press and seal the edges with your fingertips. If you are not able to seal the edges, then brush or spread some water on the edges and then seal.</li>
<li>Dust some flour on the stuffed aloo ka paratha and start rolling.</li>
<li> Roll the paratha into a round about 7 to 8 inches in diameter, or about the size of a normal roti or chapati.</li>
<li>On a hot tawa (skillet or griddle), place the rolled paratha. The tawa should be quite hot; cooking parathas at a low flame will harden them. Ideally, the finished parathas are crisp as well as soft.</li>
<li>When the base is partly cooked, flip the paratha using a spatula. You will see some air pockets on this side.</li>
<li>Spread some ghee or a neutral flavored oil (e.g. sunflower) on the partly cooked part.</li>
<li>Flip again and you will see nice golden blisters on the second side. To clarify, the side which has been spread with ghee will be on the bottom.</li>
<li>Spread some ghee on the second side facing you. A well-made and well-roasted alu paratha will always puff up when roasting</li>
<li>Flip again once or twice till both sides are cooked properly, with crisp brown spots. You should also press the alu paratha edges down with a spatula or spoon so that they are fried well. Repeat, making all parathas this way</li>
